# Character Records Generator (for Nova Sector)

[Find the latest release here](TBD) - just download the character-records-generator.zip from the latest release and you're good to go.

A tool for making setting up employment, medical, and security records a little easier on Aurora, forked from the AuroraRecordGenerator originally created by Lohikar.

This modification of the records generator has been made up to date with all of the latest changes to the server, and to better match the example records present on (TBD). Some redundant fields have been removed, and nearly all of the fields are now optional rather than being listed as 'not specified', hopefully to make filling out the records less of a chore if you want to do it piece by piece as you play.
